# Password Protection
Default password is `55`, without quotations.
You can customize the password to be anything that you can type on the calculator, just change it on the second line. The statement originally states If A=55 (enter arrow) Then
Place the remainder of your program after the "Then", and then copy and paste the Else statement AFTER the end of your program. Failure to do so will result in your program not being password protected.
